# Update

I've come to the conclusion that I've pushed this as far as I want to
under the current Handlebars-based implementation.

Instead, I'm going to reimplement the app from the ground up using AngularJS.
And instead of trying to do it on top of the ashes of my Handlebars version,
I'm just going to rename it, and more or less abandon this version it as it
now is.
