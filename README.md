I've come to the conclusion that I've pushed this as far as I want to
under the current Handlebars-based implementation.

Instead, I'm going to reimplement the app from the ground up using AngularJS,
and then proceed from there.

And instead of trying to do my reimplementation on top of the ashes of my
Handlebars version, I'm just going to rename the Handlebars version, and more
or less abandon this version code as it now is.

For what it is, it's been pretty reliable for the ~2 years that I've been
using it. But I want a better navigation system, and a way to enter and
modify transactions (and accounts) without having to use a separate program.
